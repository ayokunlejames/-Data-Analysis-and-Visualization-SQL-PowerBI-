## Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-SQL-PowerBI
In this project, I extracted insights from a charity organization's donations database by defining the business problem, carrying out a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of the problem, and visualizing insights extracted to aid planning and strategy for the fundraising team.
This repo contains all SQL queries (DDL & DQL), PowerBI visualizations (dashboards), and a full project report.
